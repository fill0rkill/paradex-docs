title: Trading Fees
---

Paradex uses a maker-taker fee model based on the notional value of the trade:

| **Fee Type** | **Rate** | **Cap** |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Taker Fee    | 4 basis points (0.04%) of underlying notional | 500% of Option Price |
| Maker Fee    | 1 basis point (0.01%) of underlying notional  | 500% of Option Price |

## Example

Alice (taker) trades 2 BTC-USD-90000-C against Bob (maker) with BTC spot price at $100,000:
- Alice pays: 0.0004 × 2 × $100,000 = $80
- Bob pays: 0.0001 × 2 × $100,000 = $20
