# Understanding Perpetual Options

## Core Concepts

### Call Options

A Call option gives the holder the right to benefit from price increases above the strike price. The intrinsic value of a Call option is:

$$\text{max}(\text{Spot Price} - \text{Strike Price}, 0)$$

* When \text{Spot Price} > \text{Strike Price}: The option is "in-the-money" (ITM)
* When \text{Spot Price} < \text{Strike Price}: The option is "out-of-the-money" (OTM)

### Put Options

A Put option gives the holder the right to benefit from price decreases below the strike price. The intrinsic value of a Put option is:

$$\text{max}(\text{Strike Price} - \text{Spot Price}, 0)$$

* When Spot Price < Strike Price: The option is "in-the-money" (ITM)
* When Spot Price > Strike Price: The option is "out-of-the-money" (OTM)

### Time Value

In Perpetual Options, Time Value is the difference between the mark price of the option and its intrinsic value:

$$\text{Time Value} = \text{Mark Price} - \text{Intrinsic Value}$$

This Time Value represents the premium traders are willing to pay for the option's potential future value.
