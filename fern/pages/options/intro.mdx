# What are Perpetual Options?

Perpetual Options are a novel new crypto derivative instrument that combines the risk-reward profile of options (protected downside with unlimited upside) with the simplicity of perpetual futures.

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
Perpetual Options fit naturally within the derivative framework crypto traders know and love (perpetuals) while offering a new way to access leverage without taking price-based liquidation risk.
</Tip>

Perpetual options are:

1. Options that never expire - Unlike traditional options that have a fixed expiration date, Perpetual Options can be held indefinitely, reducing expiry timing risk

2. Continuously funded instruments - Instead of paying a large premium upfront, traders pay (or receive) a continuous funding rate based on market conditions to hold a position

3. Simplified derivatives - They follow the same straightforward PnL structure as perpetual futures (entry price, exit price, funding)

# Why Trade Perpetual Options?

Perpetual options blend the upside of leverage with built‑in downside protection—so you can stay in a trade, without the constant threat of getting liquidated (by price).

Perp Options Funding = Cost of Leverage + Built‑in Insurance

In perp options, the extra funding also covers downside protection, so price swings are less deadly.
Perp Futures Funding = Cost of Leverage

In perp futures, funding just pays for leverage.
